Note: Im not sure if it is just my computer or if it is truly something I have written wrong but when I run the macro the first time, the formatting only shows one color for all the values, but once I run it a second time it properly formats. Ive looked at the code and Im not sure what the problem could be so you might have to run the macro twice to get the proper formatting on the "Yearly Change" value.
