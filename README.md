# VBA-repository
I saved my VBA macro inside of the xlsm file that i uploaded which is just a blank worksheet. so you would have to open up the blank worksheet with the macro in it and the file you are running the code on seperately.


Note: Im not sure if it is just my computer or if it is truly something I have written wrong but when I run the macro the first time, the formatting only shows one color for all the values, but once I run it a second time it properly formats. Ive looked at the code and Im not sure what the problem could be so you might have to run the macro twice to get the proper formatting on the "Yearly Change" value.
